## 🌟 What's Pouranik?

Pouranik is a web platform where you can:

- **Search and explore books** from public APIs (like Google Books)
- **Browse genres**, whether you love self-help, fantasy, biographies, technology, or ancient literature etc, you can discover hidden gems
- **Write reviews** and read what others say
- **Join book groups**, share your thoughts, and build reading circles
- **Buy and sell second-hand books**
- **Set reading goals** and finish books with a personal timer
- **Chat with group members**, like a digital book club!

It’s more than a reading app. It’s your **reading journey, tracked and shared**.

## 💡 Why the name **"Pouranik"**?

The word **Paurāṇika** comes from Sanskrit, meaning **ancient, mythical, or timeless.**

Just like timeless stories that live on for centuries, Pouranik aims to preserve and spread the magic of reading while bringing it into the digital age.  
**Pouranik** is built on that idea: to help people connect, share thoughts, and grow together through books.
